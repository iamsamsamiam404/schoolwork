**** DONE Implement VMware Thinapp
DEADLINE:<2024-06-28 Fri>
- [X] Package Microsoft Visio 7 and deploy to your physical machines using thinapp
*** Notes
**** Add Additional Virtual Machines
- New virtual machines may be added to either ESXi server and stored on any available datastore.
**** System Backup
- Configure the built-in backup solution (MS Backup) to automatically back up the Domain
Controller database and all user files on the domain controllers to a share on the physical
Windows 10 client. Implement a media (backup file) rotation scheme per lecture. To schedule the
backups to run automatically you will have to use the utility built into Windows 2012 Server.
**** Printing
- Create two print queues for the lab printer – one that duplexes and one that doesn't. Experiment
with controlling the printer (start/stop the queue, etc.) and other users’ print jobs. The printer is a
limited, shared resource so minimizing actual printing during this process will help all groups.
Pause the printer to enable multiple jobs to be queued, then re-order/delete print jobs.
**** Distributed File System (DFS)
- Implement a DFS domain namespace such that =\\yourdomain.tld\dfs= shows available network
shares. Reconfigure folder redirection/profiles/etc to refer to the DFS namespace
=(\\yourdomain.tld\dfs\share)= rather than the server =(\\server\share).=
- Implement DFS replication so that the shares in the server namespace are replicated between the
two domain controllers and are available on each. The client at each site should connect to the
server at their site to access the share. The physical server being accessed can be shown by using
the netstat command to show open connections.
Additional information on DFS can be found on Microsoft Technet at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/dfs-namespaces/dfs-overview.
**** Windows Server Update Services
- Enable Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) on a new Windows Server instance.
Create, partition, and format a second virtual hard drive to house the update store.
- Once WSUS is installed, updates will have to downloaded and authorized for your Windows 10
and Windows Server hosts. Only download updates for these two operating systems. To save
time, your WSUS server can be configured to get updates from the CIT/NET WSUS server at
wsus.cit.lcl.
- Clients that are members of the domain can easily be configured to receive updates from the
WSUS server automatically using group policy.
**** VMware Thinapp
Using a clean install of Windows 10, take a snapshot and install Thinapp. Run the Thinapp setup-
capture and install Visio. Concluded setup-capture and save the package to a network location.
Revert to the snapshot and run the package on the computer

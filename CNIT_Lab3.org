*** WSUS (32:36-END)
"Windows Software Update Service"
- Need to make another windows server for this
  + Install WSUS onto it
- We just need the updates for windows 10 and server 2019 and maybe 2022(for SCDC1)
- You have to tell each of your devices about the WSUS server(so it can get its updates from there)
  + Use group policy for this

- [ ] Create a share on a Windows 10 client in your outer virtualization layer to use as
a backup target
 + [ ] Add a new disk to the Windows 10 client VM to house backups
- [ ] To conserve disk space in the lab environment, backup only user files and the
domain controller database (DCDB)
- [ ] Follow best practices as defined in lecture for backups
- [ ] You need only keep one week’s worth of data
**** TODO Printing
DEADLINE:<2024-06-22 Sun>
- [ ] Create a new user and make them a print operator/administrator
  + [ ] Experiment with controlling the printer and other user’s print jobs
- [ ] Create a second queue for the printer that prints on legal size paper
  + [ ] Make the legal size printer available to only members of the administrators group
**** TODO Clone the Windows Server VM template and implement an IIS web server
DEADLINE:<2024-06-23 Mon>
https://purdue.brightspace.com/d2l/le/content/1013650/viewContent/16679581/View
- [ ] Configure a public web page on the server that anyone can access
- [ ] Configure a private web page on the server that only members of the domain can access
- [ ] Configure a site-specific web page that only machines on the first VLAN can access
**** TODO Implement DFS across your two domain controllers
DEADLINE:<2024-06-24 Tue>
- [ ] Implement a DFS domain namespace
  + [ ] Change the references to the shares hosting home directories and desktops in
profiles, folder redirection, and group policy to reference the DFS namespace
share instead of a specific server share
- [ ] Implement DFS replication to replicate home directory and desktop data between the
domain controllers
 + [ ] Using DFS and the Active Directory sites tool configure the domain such that the
clients access the shares from the domain controller at their site.
*** Phase 2
**** TODO Clone the Windows Server VM template and implement a Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) instance
DEADLINE:<2024-06-25 Wed>
- [ ] Add a second 80 GB virtual hard drive (thin provisioned) to house downloaded
updates
- [ ] Configure your clients to pull updates from your WSUS server via a GPO
**** TODO Use PowerShell Remote to list/stop/start services on a remote machine
DEADLINE:<2024-06-26 Thu>
**** TODO Implement VMware Thinapp
DEADLINE:<2024-06-27 Fri>
- [ ] Package Microsoft Visio 7 and deploy to your physical machines using thinapp
*** Notes
**** Add Additional Virtual Machines
- New virtual machines may be added to either ESXi server and stored on any available datastore.
**** System Backup
- Configure the built-in backup solution (MS Backup) to automatically back up the Domain
Controller database and all user files on the domain controllers to a share on the physical
Windows 10 client. Implement a media (backup file) rotation scheme per lecture. To schedule the
backups to run automatically you will have to use the utility built into Windows 2012 Server.
**** Printing
- Create two print queues for the lab printer – one that duplexes and one that doesn't. Experiment
with controlling the printer (start/stop the queue, etc.) and other users’ print jobs. The printer is a
limited, shared resource so minimizing actual printing during this process will help all groups.
Pause the printer to enable multiple jobs to be queued, then re-order/delete print jobs.
**** Distributed File System (DFS)
- Implement a DFS domain namespace such that =\\yourdomain.tld\dfs= shows available network
shares. Reconfigure folder redirection/profiles/etc to refer to the DFS namespace
=(\\yourdomain.tld\dfs\share)= rather than the server =(\\server\share).=
- Implement DFS replication so that the shares in the server namespace are replicated between the
two domain controllers and are available on each. The client at each site should connect to the
server at their site to access the share. The physical server being accessed can be shown by using
the netstat command to show open connections.
Additional information on DFS can be found on Microsoft Technet at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/storage/dfs-namespaces/dfs-overview.
**** Windows Server Update Services
- Enable Microsoft Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) on a new Windows Server instance.
Create, partition, and format a second virtual hard drive to house the update store.
- Once WSUS is installed, updates will have to downloaded and authorized for your Windows 10
and Windows Server hosts. Only download updates for these two operating systems. To save
time, your WSUS server can be configured to get updates from the CIT/NET WSUS server at
wsus.cit.lcl.
- Clients that are members of the domain can easily be configured to receive updates from the
WSUS server automatically using group policy.
**** VMware Thinapp
Using a clean install of Windows 10, take a snapshot and install Thinapp. Run the Thinapp setup-
capture and install Visio. Concluded setup-capture and save the package to a network location.
Revert to the snapshot and run the package on the computer
**** IP Tables
- Primary (Site1)
  - 44.100.10.0/24
- Secondary (Site2)
  - 44.100.60.0/24

* Business Case
* Procedures

In this lab, we followed a two-phase process to convert a virtual environment into a nested virtual environment using VMware vSphere. Each phase had distinct objectives and steps, which were organized based on tasks and components involved. This documentation is written in past tense to accurately describe the procedures followed. The formatting is as follows: buttons are *bold*, options are _italicized_, text entered into the computer is in `code`, and menu navigation is indicated by the pipe symbol and italic words: _Start | Programs | MS Office | Word_.

* Problem Solving (Sam)
* Results (Sam)
In this lab, a nested virtual environment was successfully created and configured using VMware vSphere. This involved setting up two ESXi servers, installing a vCenter server, and migrating existing virtual machines from a VMware Workstation environment into the new ESXi environment. Various VMware tools and techniques were utilized to manage and optimize the virtual environment, ensuring efficient resource allocation and network configuration. The following sections detail the physical and logical network setups, the IP schema, and computer names along with login information.
